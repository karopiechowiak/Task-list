# To-do App

It's a simple to-do app I've created in order to learn React. You may add and delete tasks however you wish.

## Adding a task

If you want to add a task, type it in the input field and press enter or click on the plus button. However, if you leave the input field empty, you will see an alert.

## Deleting a task

If you want to delete a task, click on the trashbin button right next to it.

## Overall

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Enjoy!
